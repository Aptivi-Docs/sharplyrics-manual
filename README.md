# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Welcome to SharpLyrics! It's a library that allows you to process your .lrc or .txt lyric files with the basic and extended formats for use in your own music player that supports lyrics.

To use this library, go to any page in the left side of the screen.

## Installation

This library is very easy to install. It's available at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpLyrics/). Just follow these steps:

1. Open your project file (`.csproj` or `.fsproj`)
2. Place the `PackageReference` line on a property group like so:
   * `<PackageReference Include="SharpLyrics" Version="x.x.x" />`
   * ...where `Version` is the current version of the library
3. Run a package restore using `dotnet restore`

If you follow these steps correctly, you should be able to use the SharpLyrics functions.
